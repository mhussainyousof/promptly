# 🪄 Promptly — Lightweight AI Chatbot App  

🚀 **Promptly** is my **AI-powered chatbot prototype**, designed to test fast model integration and conversational UI/UX in Flutter.  
After 72 hours of brainstorming, testing, and development, the first version is live!

---

## 🧠 **About the Project**

**Promptly** is a **lightweight AI chatbot** that accepts both **text and image inputs**, built primarily for testing the capabilities of modern LLMs like **Gemini 1.5 Flash**. This is not a production-ready app — it's a **developer prototype** to explore conversational app design with performance in mind.

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

- 💙 **Flutter** – Cross-platform UI toolkit  
- 📦 **Riverpod** – Clean and reactive state management  
- 🤖 **Gemini 1.5 Flash** – Fast and efficient language model by Google  
- 🧠 **LLM API integration** – Custom prompt handling and response display  
- 📷 **Image picker** – For user image input

## 🧩 **Features**

✅ **Send text and image messages**  
✅ **Real-time chat UI with typing indicator**  
✅ **Smooth model integration (via Gemini 1.5 Flash)**  
✅ **Responsive UI across screen sizes**  
❌ No audio or image generation (yet)  

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

To understand the process of connecting an LLM to a custom frontend (Flutter) and experiment with AI-focused UX patterns.  
This project helped me explore the challenges of working with prompt/response cycles, model limitations, and visual UX for AI tools.
